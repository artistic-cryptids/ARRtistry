# About ARRtistry
_ARRtistry_ provides a distributed registry that art market professionals can embrace -- they no longer have to trust one central entity with their data. Our system automatically builds public, tamper-evident, tamper-resistant provenance trails using `Ethereum` smart contracts, `Arweave Deploy` for the React UI, and `arweave.js` for metadata.
    
Under _ARRtistry_: 
- Forgeries can be detected and traced.
- Collectors are guaranteed to have the value of their piece preserved via the provenance trail.
- Art market professionals have less paperwork and can signal reputability.
- Regulators have a market they can finally collect data on.
- Artists are paid more money, more often.
